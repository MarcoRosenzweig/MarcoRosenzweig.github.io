The trend towards more compact and efficient low-pressure turbine (LPT) designs depends on accurately capturing the complex transitional and turbulent nature of unsteady flows in LPTs. 
This often necessitates high-fidelity methods such as Large Eddy Simulations (LES) to achieve reliable predictions of turbine efficiency and loss generation. 
In recent years, LES have become increasingly feasible, driven by continuous advancements in high-performance architectures, particularly through the use of accelerated graphical processing units (GPUs).
These developments have enabled highly resolved parametric sweep studies of multi-stage LPT designs. 
Traditionally, the vast amounts of data generated are analyzed using time-averaged or phase-locked-averaged techniques, which offer limited insight into the inherently unsteady and multi-scale mechanisms behind loss generation. 
This technical blog seeks to complement conventional post-processing approaches by analyzing time-resolved data using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and spectral POD (SPOD). 
Following the methodology in<sup><a href="#ref_pawel_01">[1]</a></sup>, the extracted POD modes are employed to reconstruct a stagnation pressure transport equation that governs efficiency, offering insights into mode-to-mode interactions and energy transfer rates linked to loss generation.
